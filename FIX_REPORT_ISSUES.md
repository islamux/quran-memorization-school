üìã Plan to Fix All Issues in REPORT.md

1. Fix Data Management System Duplication üîß
Problem: There are two Context files (DataContext.tsx and DexieDataContext.tsx) causing confusion
Solution:
‚Ä¢  Remove the old DataContext.tsx that uses localStorage
‚Ä¢  Keep only DexieDataContext.tsx as the single source of truth
‚Ä¢  Update all imports to use DexieDataContext consistently
‚Ä¢  Remove SQLite code from database.ts

2. Clean Up Unnecessary Files üóëÔ∏è
Problem: Android/Gradle files, build files, and disabled SQLite code
Solution:
‚Ä¢  Delete all Android/Gradle related files and directories
‚Ä¢  Remove app/ directory completely
‚Ä¢  Clean up database.ts or remove it if not needed
‚Ä¢  Remove build directories from repository

3. Fix Context Usage Consistency üîÑ
Problem: Some pages import from DataContext, others from DexieDataContext
Solution:
‚Ä¢  Update all component imports to use DexieDataContext
‚Ä¢  Ensure all pages use the same useData hook
‚Ä¢  Test each page to ensure no "useData must be used within a DataProvider" errors

4. Fix Structure Issues üèóÔ∏è
Problem: mockData is used as default data despite having a database
Solution:
‚Ä¢  Move mockData to a development/seed data file
‚Ä¢  Implement proper database initialization
‚Ä¢  Use mockData only for development seeding, not production

Step-by-Step Execution Order:

1. First: Back up the project (create a git branch)
2. Clean up files:
‚Ä¢  Remove app/ directory and all Android files
‚Ä¢  Clean build directories
3. Consolidate data management:
‚Ä¢  Delete DataContext.tsx
‚Ä¢  Update all imports to use DexieDataContext
‚Ä¢  Remove or clean database.ts
4. Fix mockData usage:
‚Ä¢  Move to seed data approach
‚Ä¢  Update initialization logic
5. Test all pages:
‚Ä¢  Verify each page loads without Context errors
‚Ä¢  Check data persistence works correctly
