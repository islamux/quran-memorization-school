## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Hydration Errors
These errors occurred when the server-side rendered HTML didn't match what React expected during client-side hydration.

#### Fixed Files:
- `/src/contexts/DexieDataContext.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/attendance/page.tsx`

#### Solutions Applied:

1. **DexieDataContext Loading State**
   - **Problem**: Component returned different JSX structure during loading vs loaded states
   - **Solution**: Moved loading indicator inside the Provider component to maintain consistent structure

2. **Date-related Hydration Issues**
   - **Problem**: Using `new Date()` directly in renders produced different values between server and client
   - **Solution**: 
     - Used `useState` with empty initial values
     - Set actual dates in `useEffect` to ensure client-only execution
     - Removed direct date comparisons in render

### 2. Context Import Errors
The application was using two different data contexts which caused "useData must be used within a DataProvider" errors.

#### Fixed Files:
- `/src/app/[locale]/students/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/teachers/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/teachers/add-teacher/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/teachers/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/students/[id]/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/students/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/[locale]/students/add-student/page.tsx`
- `/src/utils/clientDataUtils.ts`

#### Solution:
- Updated all imports from `@/contexts/DataContext` to `@/contexts/DexieDataContext`
- Ensured consistent context usage throughout the application

## Best Practices for Preventing These Issues

### 1. Avoid Hydration Mismatches
- Never use `Date()`, `Math.random()`, or other non-deterministic values in initial renders
- Use `useEffect` for client-only logic
- Initialize state with static values, then update in `useEffect`

### 2. Consistent Context Usage
- Use a single data context provider throughout the application
- Ensure all components import from the same context file
- Document which context should be used in the project

### 3. Loading States
- Keep component structure consistent between loading and loaded states
- Place conditional content inside the provider, not outside
- Use skeleton screens or spinners that don't change the component tree

## Testing Recommendations

1. Always check the browser console for hydration warnings
2. Test the application with JavaScript disabled to see SSR output
3. Use React Developer Tools to inspect component tree consistency
4. Run `npm run build` periodically to catch SSR issues early

## Current Status
✅ All hydration errors fixed
✅ All context import errors resolved
✅ Application runs without console errors
✅ Data persistence working correctly with IndexedDB
